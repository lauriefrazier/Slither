### To run the program, in the terminal please run
````

### This will load a link to use on the local URL on localhost:8502 or on a network url ending in 8502. 8520 is Streamlit's platform for web deployment. Please select one.
### Please also insure you have NMAP installed into your PATH on your device. You will also need to be hardwired into your internet in order for the scans to work. If you need to install NMAP, please [click here](https://nmap.org/download).
## Purpose of Project
Slither uses a NMAP API and displays your TCP Connect Scan or UDP Scan in a easy visual to understand quickly what your network has. 
Slither runs a scan through a IP address given by the user and runs it through the top 50 ports being used on your device.
## How to run Slither
When you are at the webframe, please enter in your desired IP Address you are wanting to scan, chose TCP Connect or UDP Scan and then press "Run Scan".
